### Hi there 👋

I'm Mohammed AlShannaq, a passionate programmer and tech enthusiast based in Jordan . I love diving into the world of coding, exploring new technologies, and building innovative solutions.

- ⚡ Fun fact: If you're not paying, then you're not the customer, you're the product ... so self-host your products. 😎
